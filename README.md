# Web Nim

Nim (game) that I made on the web.

## Game Rule

There are several piles of coins below. Each player must pick a pile and take at least one coin when it is player's turn. So the one **who takes the last coin** is the winner.

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Shortcut         | Action      |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| `N`              | New game    |
| `Enter`, `Space` | Pass turn   |
| `Esc`            | Options     |
| `1`, `D`         | First pile  |
| `2`, `F`         | Second pile |
| `3`, `J`         | Third pile  |
| `4`, `K`         | Forth pile  |
